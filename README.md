### Information
- For the UML class diagram we have not included any properties, since this is not deemed as important as the other information included.
- Furthermore in the UML class diagram we have also included dependencies to boat/member even though these om some cases only are used as a part of a forEach.
- For the sequence diagrams we have assumed the actor has selected the menu items for the respective sequence.
- Boat and Member needed to be constructorless classes in order to work with Firestores attribute functionality (easy serialization/convertation).
- Added error handling functionality in code and displayed this in the UML even though this was not a requirement for grade 2.
